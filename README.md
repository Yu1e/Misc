# ⚡ Daily Single-File Noname Kanban

This entire README (including all feature descriptions, formatting, and even this line) was completely generated by AI. Yes, TOO.

Kanban board contained entirely within a single HTML file. Designed for minimizing clicks, and keeping your workflow in one streamlined window.

## 🚀 Key Features

### ⚡ Workflow & Efficiency
*   **Single-File Architecture:** Zero dependencies, no installation. Just open `kanban.html`.
*   **Frictionless UX:** Designed to minimize clicks. Almost every action is "Inline" (edit in place) or "Drag & Drop".
*   **Single Window Experience:** Manage everything in one view without navigating through multiple pages.
*   **Task Templates & Duplication:** Create templates for recurring tasks and duplicate them instantly to save time.

### 📝 Advanced Task Management
*   **Subtasks Support:** Break down complex cards into manageable subtasks.
*   **Smart Linking:**
    *   **Drag & Drop Links:** Drag HTML links directly onto tasks.
    *   **Paste Support:** Paste links directly into tasks.
    *   **Subtask Binding:** Use special syntax (`_1`, `_2`) to bind specific links to specific subtasks automatically.
*   **Personal Dashboard:** A separate, dedicated window/list for personal tasks, keeping them distinct from your main workflow.

### 💾 Data & Security
*   **Daily Backups:** Automatic daily export/saving to a local JSON file.
*   **Import Capability:** Initialize or restore the board from a JSON file (supports importing from an empty structure).
*   **Local Privacy:** All data lives in your browser or local files. No cloud servers involved.

### 🎉 Motivation & Gamification
*   **Custom Affirmations:** Add your own motivational phrases (e.g., "You’ve got this!", "One step closer to mastery!").
*   **Special Effects:** Trigger confetti explosions, sound effects, or custom animations when moving tasks to "Done".
*   **Personal Rewards:** Define rewards that appear automatically upon task completion (e.g., "Take a 5-minute break", "Enjoy your favorite song").

## 🛠️ How to Use

### Basic Operations
1.  **Add/Edit:** Click to add items. Click text to inline-edit.
2.  **Organize:** Drag and drop tasks between columns. Drag links onto tasks to attach them.

### Advanced Syntax (Link Binding)
If you have multiple links attached to a task, you can assign them to specific subtasks using underscores:
*   Type `_1` in a subtask to make it clickable using the **1st** attached link.
*   Type `_2` for the **2nd** link, and so on.

### Personal Mode
Access the dedicated "Personal" list to manage private to-dos separately from the main board columns.
